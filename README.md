# CSV-Printer
Prints individual lines of a csv file, your csv of choice must be in the same directory as the python file. How fast the program prints lines is dependent on the time.sleep function at the bottom of the program. This program becomes unstable if it loops with no limit on time, this can cause you to lose control of your pc if it is typing out of the intended space.
